Certainly! Here is a detailed, line-by-line explanation of the provided Python code, describing the purpose and logic of each part:  1. **from dotenv import load_dotenv**      This imports the `load_dotenv` function from the `dotenv` package. This function is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into the program’s environment.  2. **import os**      Imports the `os` module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as reading environment variables and running system commands.  3. **import sys**      Imports the `sys` module, which allows access to system-specific parameters and functions, such as command-line arguments.  4. **from PIL import Image, ImageDraw**      Imports the `Image` and `ImageDraw` classes from the Python Imaging Library (PIL). `Image` is used for opening and manipulating images, while `ImageDraw` is used for drawing shapes and text on images.
5. **from matplotlib import pyplot as plt**      Imports the `pyplot` module from `matplotlib` and gives it the alias `plt`. This module is used for creating and displaying plots and images.  6. **# Import namespaces**      This is a comment indicating where additional imports (namespaces) might be added, but no code is present here.  ---  ### The `main` function  7. **def main():**      Defines the main function, which will contain the primary logic of the script.  8. **os.system('cls' if os.name=='nt' else 'clear')**      Clears the console screen. If the operating system is Windows (`os.name == 'nt'`), it runs the `cls` command; otherwise, it runs `clear` (for Unix-like systems).  9. **try:**      Begins a try-except block to catch and handle any exceptions that occur during execution.  10. **load_dotenv()**       Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the program’s environment.
10. **load_dotenv()**       Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the program’s environment.  11. **cog_endpoint = os.getenv('AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT')**       Retrieves the value of the environment variable `AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` and stores it in the variable `cog_endpoint`.  12. **cog_key = os.getenv('AI_SERVICE_KEY')**       Retrieves the value of the environment variable `AI_SERVICE_KEY` and stores it in the variable `cog_key`.  13. **image_file = 'images/face1.jpg'**       Sets the default image file path to `'images/face1.jpg'`.  14. **if len(sys.argv) > 1:**       Checks if any command-line arguments were provided (other than the script name).  15. **image_file = sys.argv[1]**       If a command-line argument is provided, it uses the first argument as the image file path instead of the default.  16. **# Authenticate Face client**       A placeholder comment indicating where code to authenticate a Face API client would go.
16. **# Authenticate Face client**       A placeholder comment indicating where code to authenticate a Face API client would go.  17. **# Specify facial features to be retrieved**       A placeholder comment for specifying which facial features to retrieve from the API.  18. **# Get faces**       A placeholder comment for the code that would call the API to detect faces in the image.  19. **except Exception as ex:**       Catches any exceptions that occur in the try block.  20. **print(ex)**       Prints the exception message to the console.  ---  ### The `annotate_faces` function  21. **def annotate_faces(image_file, detected_faces):**       Defines a function to annotate detected faces on an image. It takes the image file path and a list of detected face objects as arguments.  22. **print('\nAnnotating faces in image...')**       Prints a message indicating that face annotation is starting.  23. **fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,
