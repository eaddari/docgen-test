SignAzure Portal2. Create Language resource enable question answering3. AssociateAzure AI Searchindex4. InLanguage Studio: - Create Custom question answering project - Add data sources (URLs, files, chit-chat sets)### 2. Implement Multi-Turn Conversations- Add follow-up prompts questions clarify user intent- Link follow-ups existing answers create new ones- Ensure responses context-aware within multi-turn flow### 3. Test Publish KB- Test questions interactively Language Studio- Review confidence scores possible answer alternatives- When ready, deploy KB REST endpoint external use### 4. Use Knowledge Base via APISend HTTP POST requests JSON like:json{ "question": "What I need cancel reservation?", "top": 2, "scoreThreshold": 20, "strictFilters": [ { "name": "category", "value": "api" } ]}Response includes:matched question, answer, score, metadata### 5. Improve Performance Active Learning- Enable automatic suggestion alternate phrasings- Use Review suggestions pane approve/reject them-
