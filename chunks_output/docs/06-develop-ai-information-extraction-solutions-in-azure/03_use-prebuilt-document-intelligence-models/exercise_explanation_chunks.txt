Certainly! Here is a detailed, line-by-line explanation of the provided Python code, describing the purpose and logic of each part:  ---  **Importing Required Libraries**  - `from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential`   - This line imports the `AzureKeyCredential` class, which is used to securely provide your Azure API key when authenticating requests to Azure services.  - `from azure.ai.formrecognizer import DocumentAnalysisClient`   - This line imports the `DocumentAnalysisClient` class, which is the main client used to interact with the Azure AI Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer) service for analyzing documents.  ---  **Storing Connection Information**  - `endpoint = "<Endpoint URL>"`   - This variable is meant to store the endpoint URL of your Azure AI Document Intelligence resource. You should replace the placeholder with your actual endpoint.
- `endpoint = "<Endpoint URL>"`   - This variable is meant to store the endpoint URL of your Azure AI Document Intelligence resource. You should replace the placeholder with your actual endpoint.  - `key = "<API Key>"`   - This variable holds your Azure API key, which is required for authenticating requests to the service. Replace the placeholder with your actual key.  ---  **Specifying the Document and Model**  - `fileUri = "https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-document-intelligence/blob/main/Labfiles/01-prebuild-models/sample-invoice/sample-invoice.pdf?raw=true"`   - This variable contains the URL of the PDF document (an invoice) that you want to analyze. The document is hosted online and will be accessed directly by the service.  - `fileLocale = "en-US"`   - This variable specifies the locale (language and region) of the document. Here, it is set to US English.
- `fileLocale = "en-US"`   - This variable specifies the locale (language and region) of the document. Here, it is set to US English.  - `fileModelId = "prebuilt-invoice"`   - This variable specifies the ID of the prebuilt model to use for analysis. In this case, it uses the prebuilt invoice model provided by Azure.  ---  **Printing Connection and Analysis Information**  - `print(f"\nConnecting to Forms Recognizer at: {endpoint}")`   - This line prints a message to the console, indicating the endpoint to which the client will connect.  - `print(f"Analyzing invoice at: {fileUri}")`   - This line prints the URL of the invoice document that will be analyzed.  ---  **Creating the Document Analysis Client**
- `print(f"Analyzing invoice at: {fileUri}")`   - This line prints the URL of the invoice document that will be analyzed.  ---  **Creating the Document Analysis Client**  - `document_analysis_client = DocumentAnalysisClient(endpoint=endpoint, credential=AzureKeyCredential(key))`   - This line creates an instance of the `DocumentAnalysisClient` class, initializing it with the endpoint and credentials. This client will be used to send requests to the Azure service.  ---  **Submitting the Document for Analysis**  - `poller = document_analysis_client.begin_analyze_document_from_url(fileModelId, fileUri, locale=fileLocale)`   - This line starts the analysis of the document at the specified URL using the chosen prebuilt model and locale. The method returns a poller object, which can be used to track the progress and retrieve the results once the analysis is complete.  ---  **Retrieving the Analysis Results**
---  **Retrieving the Analysis Results**  - `receipts = poller.result()`   - This line waits for the analysis to complete and retrieves the results. The results contain the extracted information from the document, such as fields and their values.  ---  **Processing and Displaying Extracted Information**  - `for idx, receipt in enumerate(receipts.documents):`   - This loop iterates over each document in the results (in this case, likely just one invoice). The `enumerate` function provides both the index and the document object.    - Inside the loop:     - `vendor_name = receipt.fields.get("VendorName")`       - Attempts to retrieve the "VendorName" field from the extracted fields. If the field exists, it is stored in `vendor_name`.      - `if vendor_name:`       - Checks if the "VendorName" field was found.       - `print(f"\nVendor Name: {vendor_name.value}, with confidence {vendor_name.confidence}.")
