[H1] Understand Prebuilt Models## ProblemYou need extract structured data names, addresses, amounts common documents like invoices, receipts, unstructured forms. How efficiently without training custom models?## Solution AzureUseprebuilt modelsAzure AI Document Intelligence. These models trained Microsoft large datasets optimized extracting information common document types without requiring custom training.## Required Components-Azure AI Document Intelligence-Prebuilt models(e.g., Invoice, Receipt, ID Document, etc.)-Client applicationAzure portaltesting integration## Architecture / Development### What Are Prebuilt Models?Prebuilt models trained large corpora specific document types ready use. They eliminate need manual training optimized accuracy reliability.### Available Prebuilt Models:-Invoice model: Extracts fields invoices.-Receipt model: Extracts fields receipts.-US Tax model: Extracts data W-2, 1098, 1099, 1040 forms.-ID document model: Extracts fields US, EU, international
model: Extracts fields invoices.-Receipt model: Extracts fields receipts.-US Tax model: Extracts data W-2, 1098, 1099, 1040 forms.-ID document model: Extracts fields US, EU, international IDs.-Business card model: Extracts contact details business cards.-Health insurance card model: Extracts fields insurance cards.-Marriage certificate model: Extracts data marriage certificates.-Credit/Debit card model: Extracts card information.-Mortgage documents model: Extracts data forms like 1003, 1004, 1005, 1008.-Bank statement model: Extracts balances transactions.-Pay Stub model: Extracts wages, deductions, net pay, etc.-Check model: Extracts payee, amount, date, etc.### General Models:-Read model: Extracts text language.-General document model: Extracts text, keys, values, entities, selection marks.-Layout model: Extracts text structural layout.## Best Practices / Considerations- Use prebuilt models working standard document types save time effort.- Evaluate model output ensure meets
marks.-Layout model: Extracts text structural layout.## Best Practices / Considerations- Use prebuilt models working standard document types save time effort.- Evaluate model output ensure meets accuracy requirements.- Combine general models custom logic unstructured less common documents.## Exam-like Questions1. What main advantage using prebuilt models Azure AI Document Intelligence?2. Which model would use extract data US W-2 tax form?3. What types documents supported general document model?4. How prebuilt models differ custom-trained models?5. Which model used extract contact details business cards?# Features Prebuilt Models## ProblemYou need extract various types structured data documents forms using Azure AI. How choose right prebuilt model ensure accurate results?## Solution AzureUseprebuilt modelsAzure AI Document Intelligence, designed extract specific types data text, key-value pairs, entities, selection marks, tables, fields common document types.## Required
Solution AzureUseprebuilt modelsAzure AI Document Intelligence, designed extract specific types data text, key-value pairs, entities, selection marks, tables, fields common document types.## Required Components-Azure AI Document Intelligence-Prebuilt models(e.g., Invoice, Receipt, Business Card, etc.)-Supported input files(JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, PDF, Office files Read model)-Azure AI Document Intelligence Studio(for visual testing)## Architecture / Development### Features Prebuilt Models-Text extraction: Extracts printed handwritten text.-Key-value pairs: Identifies labels corresponding values (e.g.,Weight: 31 kg).-Entities: Extracts structured data like names, locations, dates.-Selection marks: Detects checkboxes radio buttons.-Tables: Extracts table structures, including merged cells headers.-Fields: Extracts predefined fields specific document types (e.g.,CustomerName,InvoiceTotal).### Input Requirements-File formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, PDF (Office files Read model)-File size: -
