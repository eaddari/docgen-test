Certainly! Here’s a detailed, line-by-line explanation of the provided Python code, describing the purpose and logic of each part:

---

### Imports

- **from dotenv import load_dotenv**  
  Imports the `load_dotenv` function from the `dotenv` package. This function is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into the program’s environment.

- **import os**  
  Imports the `os` module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as reading environment variables and running system commands.

- **import time**  
  Imports the `time` module, which provides time-related functions. (Note: In this code, it is imported but not used.)

- **import sys**  
  Imports the `sys` module, which allows access to system-specific parameters and functions, such as command-line arguments.

- **from PIL import Image, ImageDraw**  
  Imports the `Image` and `ImageDraw` classes from the Python Imaging Library (PIL). `Image` is used for opening and manipulating images, while `ImageDraw` is used for drawing shapes on images.

- **from matplotlib import pyplot as plt**  
  Imports the `pyplot` module from `matplotlib` and gives it the alias `plt`. This module is used for displaying and saving images and plots.

---

### Placeholder for Additional Imports

- **# import namespaces**  
  A comment indicating that additional imports (likely for Azure AI Vision or other services) should be added here.

---

### Main Function Definition

- **def main():**  
  Defines the main function, which will be the entry point of the program.

---

#### Console Clearing

- **os.system('cls' if os.name=='nt' else 'clear')**  
  Clears the console screen. If the operating system is Windows (`os.name == 'nt'`), it runs the `cls` command; otherwise, it runs `clear` (for Unix/Linux/Mac).

---

#### Try-Except Block

- **try:**  
  Begins a block to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during execution.

---

##### Load Configuration

- **load_dotenv()**  
  Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the program’s environment.

- **ai_endpoint = os.getenv('AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT')**  
  Retrieves the value of the environment variable `AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` and assigns it to `ai_endpoint`.

- **ai_key = os.getenv('AI_SERVICE_KEY')**  
  Retrieves the value of the environment variable `AI_SERVICE_KEY` and assigns it to `ai_key`.

---

##### Image File Selection

- **image_file = 'images/street.jpg'**  
  Sets the default image file path to `'images/street.jpg'`.

- **if len(sys.argv) > 1:**  
  Checks if a command-line argument was provided (other than the script name).

- **image_file = sys.argv[1]**  
  If an argument is provided, sets `image_file` to the value of the first argument, allowing the user to specify a different image file at runtime.

---

##### Placeholder Comments

- **# Authenticate Azure AI Vision client**  
  A placeholder comment indicating where code to authenticate with the Azure AI Vision service should be added.

- **# Read text in image**  
  A placeholder comment for the code that would process the image and extract text using the AI service.

- **# Print the text**  
  A placeholder comment for code that would output the recognized text.

---

##### Exception Handling

- **except Exception as ex:**  
  Catches any exception that occurs in the try block.

- **print(ex)**  
  Prints the exception message to the console.

---

### Annotate Lines Function

- **def annotate_lines(image_file, detected_text):**  
  Defines a function to annotate detected lines of text on an image.

- **print(f'\
