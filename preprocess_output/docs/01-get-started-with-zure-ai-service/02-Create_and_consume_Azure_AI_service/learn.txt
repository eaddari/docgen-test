[H1] Azure AI Services GuideProblemYou need build intelligent applications using prebuilt AI capabilities vision, language, speech, document understanding, search. How provision consume Azure AI services secure, manageable, efficient way?Azure SolutionUseAzure AI servicesconsume cloud-based AI capabilities viaREST APIsSDKs. Provision services eithermulti-servicesingle-serviceresource depending usage, scalability, management needs.Required ComponentsAzure SubscriptionAzure AI resource (multi-service single-service)Endpoint URISubscription Key(s)Azure Region (Location)REST API SDK preferred language (C#, Python, JavaScript, Java, Go)Architecture / DevelopmentProvisioning Options:Multi-service Resource: * One resource multiple AI capabilities (Language, Vision, Speech, etc.) * Single billing, credentials, endpointSingle-service Resource: * Separate resources per service * Per-region customization * Independent billing access management * Free tier often available Training vs Prediction:Some services (e.g., custom models) requireseparate training predictionresourcesAllows cost separation model training inference Consuming Services:Endpoint URI: HTTP address service requestsSubscription Key: Authenticates client applicationLocation: Azure region resourceTwo keys provided; valid regenerable Using REST APIs:Send dataJSONviaHTTP(POST, PUT, GET depending function)Receive JSON responsesLanguage-agnostic: works cURL, Postman, programming language supporting HTTP Using SDKs:Easier abstraction RESTAvailable major languages: * C# (.NET Core) * Python * JavaScript (Node.js) * Java * GoInclude service-specific classes methodsBest Practices / ConsiderationsUsemulti-service resourceunified management productionUsesingle-service resourcewhen: * You need service separation (e.g., region, security, cost) * You're testing via free tierRegenerate keys regularly enhance securityUse SDKs robust application development; use REST quick tests language-agnostic integrationAlways confirm service availability SDK support per language region official documentationSample Exam Questions1.You need build app uses Azure AI Vision Azure AI Speech.
